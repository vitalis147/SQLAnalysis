### What and Where are the World's Oldest Businesses
Use joining techniques from `SQL` to query a relational database and discover the oldest businesses in the world.

Project Description
An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the business survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this remarkably well and last for hundreds of years. In this project, there is exploration of data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded, and which industries do they belong to?

Like many business problems, the data explored is contained in several different datasets. In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, there was a need to use the joining techniques from SQL to merge our data. From there, then the manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.
